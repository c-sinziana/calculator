`node` and `npm` are needed to be installed globally on the machine with the cloned project.  

Installation:

## Personal notes 

Through this project I discovered and got familiarized with React framework.
The React functionality was implemented using functional components with React Hooks.

I started the project typing the `create-react-app` script in the terminal, with the Node Package Manager (npm), which requires Node.js installed.

The most challenging part was understanding React Hooks and how to pass data with them. 

More than that, when I tried to add functionality to my project, I kept getting some errors, which I solved by using conditional rendering. 

What I found very useful was checking everytime was needed whether the functions worked by showing the result using console.log.
